---

## 3. Validation & Error Handling

**What to cover:**

* Request validation (Zod/Joi)
* Centralized error response formatting

**Mini-Project:**
Refactor Notes API:

* Validate request bodies
* Return validation errors properly

---

## 4. JWT Authentication

**What to cover:**

* JWT generation, signing, verification
* Middleware to protect routes

**Mini-Project:**
Add authentication:

* `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`
* Store hashed passwords with bcrypt
* `GET /notes` requires valid JWT

---

## 5. Forgot & Reset Password Flows

**What to cover:**

* Token generation (crypto.randomBytes)
* Nodemailer for sending reset password email
* Password reset endpoint with token validation

**Mini-Project:**
Enhance Auth:

* `POST /auth/forgot-password`, `POST /auth/reset-password`
* Send email using Nodemailer

---

## 6. Redis & BullMQ Basics

**What to cover:**

* Redis intro
* BullMQ job queues
* Sending emails via background worker

**Mini-Project:**
Move reset-password email sending to BullMQ:

* Producer enqueues email job
* Worker processes and sends email

---

## 7. Basic Caching with Redis

**What to cover:**

* Simple cache-aside pattern
* Redis TTL keys

**Mini-Project:**
Cache `GET /notes` responses:

* Cache notes list for 30 seconds
* Invalidate cache on create/update/delete

---

## 8. Docker & Compose Basics

**What to cover:**

* Dockerize Node.js app
* Docker Compose with Node, Redis, Database

**Mini-Project:**
Wrap everything in Docker Compose:

* Node app, Redis, DB all in one stack
* Local development with Compose

---

---

# ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate Level (Scaling Up, Architecture, Production Readiness)**

## 1. Advanced Database Patterns

**What to cover:**

* Soft deletes, offset pagination
* Optimistic concurrency (versioning)
* DB transactions

**Mini-Project:**
Refine Notes/Tasks:

* Add soft delete (`deletedAt`)
* Offset pagination in `GET /notes`
* Optimistic concurrency on updates
* Bulk create tasks wrapped in transaction

---

## 2. Real-Time with Socket.IO

**What to cover:**

* Socket.IO setup with Express
* JWT authentication during handshake
* Rooms, broadcasting events
* Scaling with Redis adapter

**Mini-Project:**
Add real-time notifications:

* Clients join `user:<userId>` room
* Notify on note create/update/delete
* Use Redis adapter to test multi-instance scaling

---

## 3. File Uploads (Local or Cloud Storage)

**What to cover:**

* Handling file uploads via `multipart/form-data`
* Local storage (multer) vs AWS S3 with pre-signed URLs

**Mini-Project:**
Add task attachments:

* Endpoint to upload files (multer or S3 pre-signed URLs)
* Serve/download files securely

---

## 4. Advanced Auth (Refresh Tokens, RBAC)

**What to cover:**

* Refresh token flow (with rotation)
* Role-based access (admin/user roles)
* Token revocation

**Mini-Project:**
Extend Auth:

* Implement access/refresh tokens
* `POST /auth/refresh` to get new access token
* Admin role to manage other users

---

## 5. Microservices Architecture

**What to cover:**

* Split services (Auth, Tasks, Notifications)
* API Gateway for routing + authentication
* Inter-service communication (HTTP or Redis Pub/Sub)
* Rate-limiting sensitive endpoints

**Mini-Project:**
Split project:

* API Gateway, Auth Service, Task Service, Notification Worker
* Gateway handles authentication + rate limiting
* Redis Pub/Sub or direct HTTP calls between services
* Docker Compose multi-service setup

---

## 6. Scheduled Jobs & CRON

**What to cover:**

* BullMQ repeatable jobs
* node-cron basics

**Mini-Project:**
Add scheduled features:

* Daily CRON to mark tasks overdue
* Daily email summary using BullMQ repeatable jobs

---

## 7. Feature Flags System

**What to cover:**

* Feature toggles via Redis/DB
* Per-user feature activation

**Mini-Project:**
Build feature flags:

* API endpoint to enable/disable feature
* Conditional response: e.g., hide sorting feature if disabled

---

## 8. User-Level Rate Limiting

**What to cover:**

* Rate limit per user ID (not just IP) using Redis counters

**Mini-Project:**
Throttle `POST /tasks`:

* Max 50 tasks per user per day, Redis TTL resets count

---

## 9. Configuration Management

**What to cover:**

* Clean config structure using dotenv or config package
* Multi-environment setup (dev/staging/prod)

**Mini-Project:**
Refactor project configs:

* Centralized config folder
* Environment-specific configs via NODE\_ENV

---

## 10. CI/CD Pipeline (Lightweight)

**What to cover:**

* GitHub Actions basic setup
* Linting, testing on PR
* Optional Docker build pipeline
